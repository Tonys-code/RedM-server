# RedM-server
In this repository I will combine my C#, JS and Lua knowledge and use it to make fun RedM scripts. 
This will be used together with other scripts that are free to use, this to help other people starting a server with no knowledge by giving them a template they may copy. 

All scripts are free to use and are based on the VORP core.
